# USDConverter

### A USDZ-to-OBJ converter powered by Model I/O

## Usage

1. Download a release here https://github.com/SamusAranX/USDConverter/releases or compile the project yourself.
2. Move the `usdconv` binary somewhere into your PATH or into the same directory as the USDZ files you want to convert.
3. Execute it from the terminal like this:

```
usdconv model1.usdz
```

You can also convert multiple files in one go by simply specifying more files:

```
usdconv model1.usdz model2.usdz model3.usdz
```

### Options

```
-v, --version           Show the version number and exit.
--png                   Convert all texture formats to PNG.
--force                 Try to force conversion, even if the input format is unsupported.
--include-garbage       Keep initial files generated by Model I/O.
-h, --help              Show help information.
```

With no options specified, running `usdconv model.usdz` will output these files and directories:

* model.obj
* model.mtl
* model/(a bunch of textures in various formats)

Specify `--include-garbage` to keep the unfiltered files generated by the Model I/O framework around. Not sure why you'd do this, but the option is there if you want them. Note that in that case, usdconv will generate a file called `model.duplicates.txt` containing a list of duplicate materials, sorted by amount of occurrences.

`--force` basically only exists as a debug option and has no practical value other than that.
